This project aims to create a first-fit algorithm drop-in replacement of the standard `malloc()` and `free()`. The included header file `"mymalloc.h"` defines a directive to replace all occurrences of `malloc()` with `mymalloc()` and `free()` with `myfree()`


This project strictly conforms to the C89/C90/ANSI/gnu89 standard
